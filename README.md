PRODIGY_DS_02
Overview
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset using R programming language. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset from Kaggle, containing information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics and survival outcomes.

Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to:

Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Analyze relationships between variables.
Identify patterns and trends in the data.
Tools Used
R Programming: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
tidyverse: R package for data manipulation and ggplot2 for data visualization.
Dataset
The Titanic dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Fare: Passenger fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Contents
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing survival by gender, passenger class, age distribution, and embarked port.
Extracting insights regarding survival patterns based on different variables.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have R and RStudio installed.
Open the R project file in RStudio.
Run the R scripts in order to perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
Explore the generated plots and summaries to understand patterns in the Titanic dataset.
Future Work
Conduct further statistical tests or modeling to explore relationships more deeply.
Implement predictive modeling to predict survival outcomes based on different features.
